# Automatic Character Sheet

The purpose of this project is to create a desktop gui character sheet programme, which can interface with online resources to help present information pertinent to whatever character one might be attempting to build in whatever game system one might be playing in.

However, for the sake of simplicity, initially it will be designed to work with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game via the website d20pfsrd.com.
